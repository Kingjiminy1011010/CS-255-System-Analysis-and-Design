# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design

For these Project my client DriverPass wanted to provide students with access to online practice exams and on-the-road training to better prepare them for driving tests. I Communicated the system requirements very well to geive the client what they will need to build this system. If I could revise one part of my documentation it will be the use case diagram, I would add the DMV as a actor. Taking notes from the users meeting help me follow along with the needs of the client. It is important to implement all of the users needs if able, to satisfy the customer. In future projects I will also approach Designing software in a similar fashion by creating UML diagrams.
